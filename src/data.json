          "reviewDate": "Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2020",
          "reviewTitle": "NEVER buy expensive products from Amazon - Use Best Buy",
          "reviewText": "Instead of writing about the TV itself, my focus in this review is going to be on the disastrous process of purchasing this TV, “expert installation” and lack of reasonable support through the terrible Happiness Guarantee process once things went wrong.When I saw this TV on a great sale during Prime Day, I was excited! Since I live alone, I knew I needed to purchase expert installation to have something like this mounted. I strongly considered using Best Buy instead as I have had good experience with them, but being a long time Amazon customer I wanted to give them a try.The initial (yes, I have now been through multiple deliveries) delivery of the TV was fine. The day of the “expert installation” was scheduled the technician showed up by himself but said the TV was not heavy and he could confidently mount it to my wall on his own, as he has done before. (Question for Amazon-why would this be an acceptable policy?) I said ok and let the technician get to work. To start, he was supposed to measure 42 inches from the floor - I didn’t realize until much later but he measured 46 inches from the floor. The technician spent over an hour and a half getting things ready to put the TV on the mount. It felt like a while but I remained patient.When the time finally came, we lifted the TV onto the wall mount on the wall. The technician then went to tighten the TV to the mount and THE ENTIRE MOUNT AND TV fell out from the wall, banged things on its way and crashed on the floor. The pictures of the aftermath are what I have posted in this review - as you can clearly see, there is not only major damage to the TV but my personal property as well.The problem was clear - the knuts used to screw the mount into the wall were tiny, had no anchor and we’re not on a stud. I’m no technician but as an average person, seems pretty obvious that with an expensive 65 inch OLED that is the wrong way to securely mount it anywhere.I was now left with a broken TV and no plan to fix anything. It took me over 6 hours on the phone to setup a replacement TV to be sent and have someone pick up the broken one. The first time they were supposed to pick up the TV, Amazon did not so I had to go through this twice over a two week period and it was beyond frustrating having multiple boxes taxing up most of my apartment.The Amazon Happiness Guarantee process may have been the icing on the cake for how terrible this became. I was required to fill out tons of information but NO ONE would pick up the phone to call me and talk through it. Instead, they want me to have even more than the 6 people already in my apartment to now come in and take estimates to see what could be done to fix the work. Given my career, the amount of insane time I have put into getting this resolved to date and the risk of COVID, why is it so difficult for Amazon to find a way to offer me something to address this clear disaster they created that doesn’t put me at further risk of catching this deadly virus going around? Why couldn’t they make a phone call? Why not even an offer to waive my Prime membership for a couple of years?In case you are considering using Amazon in the future for a large TV purchase and need help with installation - DON’T DO IT! Go to Best Buy. They actually do care and backup their work. I will be documenting my experience with the second round of mounting, which has also been disappointing, in a separate review. The point I hope is clear to anyone reading this - don’t let the Amazon Happiness Guarantee make you think when things go wrong Amazon can help. The level of support that should be provided for a purchase of this size is not something Amazon is capable of - even in a case as blatantly clear as mine. Nor are they capable of effectively managing their vendors as I experienced with Goodman Solutions who serve the Denver, CO market for Amazon installations.I’m sure the TV is great... but I won’t know until I am actually able to watch it and it’s been over a month since my original purchase. I wish my focus was on the quality of the TV. Unfortunately, my focus has been and remains on Amazon’s negligence in vendor management and unacceptable approach to resolution. Felt it necessary to share so others don’t have to go through the same thing I did.",

          "reviewText": "Let's get the obvious out the way. The image quality, viewing angle, black levels are all fantastic. This is a 5-star TV through and through when it comes to image quality, especially when fed a 4K 60hz signal.But I just paid circa $2K for a TV that forces ads on me. If I disable one type of \"suggested\" programming in settings, another one comes up. It's an ad whack-a-mole. The latest one I got today was a \"Bravia Notification\", picture attached. There is no way to disable it. Want to switch from Netflix to YouTube TV? Ads. Turning on your TV? Ads.This is wrong. I will not be the product. I reject the now-common practice of forcing ads on all smart TVs. Sony+Google have crossed the line, and I refuse to believe that it's normal to just sit there and be forced to consume marketing materials as you go about simple daily tasks. Absolutely disgusted with Sony. I do not recommend this TV purely on those grounds.I honestly don't know what to do since TCL, Samsung and LG all have equally intrusive or worse ads. That doesn't make it ok for Sony to sink to this level. I had an XBR 27\" curved CRT, a 32\" flat screen XBR, a 2007 40\" XBR LED, a 2013 55\" Bravia LED and now this TV. Sony as a brand is now dead to me since it's clearly become Google's b****.",

Push the volume button down and it takes a second to respond. Then, sometimes the TV won't respond at all. Push a button on the remote and the TV just sits there...... then after pushing a different button, and another button (trying to get it to do something) you give up, and maybe think about removing power to the TV to get it to reset.... and that's when the TV responds with all of the buttons that you have pushed. ***DO NOT BUY THIS TV*** Or do buy it and prepared to be frustrated out of your mind.

          "reviewText": "The first TV arrived with a defective panel. The right 12 inches or so of the screen is noticeably brighter than the rest of the scene. Amazon provided a replacement, but it has serious issues as well. While it doesn't have the vertical banding of the first, the replacement screen has bright lines both vertically and horizontally across the screen. They are evenly spaced in a grid so must be from the manufacturing of the panel. As someone who watches a lot of darker content this makes the TV unwatchable. I expect much better from a $2500 TV.Edit. Returning this has been a nightmare. Both of the TVs were shipped back and arrived Dec 10 \u0026 15. The first one shows as returned in the Amazon app,but as of Dec 18 the second one still shows it hasn't arrived even though tracking says it has. Customer service sent me an email confirming that it had indeed arrived, but no refund or confirmation in the system that I can see that it arrived. Buy with caution incase you have to return the item as you may either have to pay the CC bill, or incur interest on the return.",
